GAME_OVERVIEW_ADDENDUM = (
    "\n\nGame overview:\n"
    "- You are solving a multi-level grid puzzle game. \n"
    "- You are called repeatedly over the course of a run. Treat each turn as one observe-plan-act cycle: re-understand the current state from the newest frame, update your working world model in Python, choose the next best action or short sequence against the goal as currently understood, execute it, and expect to re-evaluate on the next turn from the updated state.\n"
    "- Your job is to solve the entire game by clearing every level, not just the current screen.\n"
    "- Levels often build on earlier mechanics, but layouts and interactions can still change between levels.\n"
    "- Optimize for as few in-game actions as possible while still being reliable.\n"
    "- In this environment, boards are presented as 64 x 64 color grids rendered with ARC color symbols.\n"

VISUAL_GAME_ADDENDUM = (
    "\n\nVisual-game guidance:\n"
    "- Treat each board as a scene with objects, blockers, targets, adjacency, containment, motion, and symmetry.\n"
    "- Game entities are usually be rendered as connected multi-tile shapes such as 2×2, 2×3, 3×3, or longer patterned structures. Sometime they might also be 1x1 tokens."
    "- Some games are logic or layout puzzles with no explicit player avatar or controllable sprite on the board. Do not assume a player exists; the relevant state may be an object, region, cursor, selector, or whole-board configuration.\n"
    "- Background colors are often white or gray/black-ish large regions, but not always. Verify background hypotheses by area, stability, and object boundaries rather than assuming them.\n"
    "- In many games, a long horizontal or vertical line near an edge is a timer or remaining-steps bar. It often shrinks or changes each step. If you identify such a bar, do not get distracted by it or treat it as core gameplay state unless there is concrete evidence that it interacts with the puzzle mechanics.\n"
    "A common failure mode is to mistake a segmented edge bar for clickable puzzle pieces. If a repeated strip of small blocks sits flush against the top, bottom, left, or right border and actions only change that strip while the interior board stays the same, classify it as HUD/timer state, not as an object to click through segment by segment. DON'T DO THIS!\n"
    "- Use coordinates only to target actions or describe local evidence. Do not frame the objective as reaching a specific absolute row or column.\n"
    "- Re-ground on the newest frame after any score increase or abrupt scene change; the returned board may already be the next level.\n"
    "- `WIN` means the whole game is solved. Mid-run level completion is more likely to appear as a score increase while play continues.\n"
    "- Strategies may transfer loosely across levels, but layouts and mechanics can change. Re-check the new board before repeating a plan.\n"
    "- For `MOUSE`, pass `row` and `col` integer arguments. `row` is vertical position, `col` is horizontal position.\n"

    "- `current_frame.segmentation` parses the board into objects. It returns `{'nodes': [...], 'adjacency_list': [...]}`.\n"
    "- Each node in `segmentation['nodes']` is one 4-connected same-color object with: `id` (index, ordered top-most-left-most), `color` (ARC color character), `hash` (a signature of the object's color and shape that ignores its position -- equal hashes mean the same object regardless of where it is, so use it to track an object across frames or to spot multiple identical objects in one frame), `pixels` (cell count), `boundary` (clockwise outer-perimeter corner points as `[row, col]`), and `children` (ids of objects fully enclosed by this one).\n"

    "- Every `python` tool call starts fresh. Re-import modules or re-define any custom utility logic you need.\n"
    "- The only importable standard-library modules are: bisect, collections, copy, fractions, functools, heapq, itertools, json, math, operator, random, re, statistics, string.\n"
    "- The only tool is `python`; call it with one ephemeral `code` string.\n"
    "- Always inspect `current_frame`, `history`, and `valid_actions` from Python instead of reasoning from the raw board by eye.\n"
    "- For the most recent change, compare `previous_frame` to `current_frame`, or `last_transition.before_frame` to `last_transition.after_frame`. `history[-1].frame` is the current frame, so comparing it to `current_frame` only compares the board to itself.\n"
    "- Maintain a compact working world model: what entities or regions exist, what actions seem to do, what the goal likely is, what remains uncertain, and what plan best fits the evidence so far.\n"
    "- IMPORTANT: Especially when the game is about making an agent navigate to a target, it is usually safer to write an explicit search algorithm such as BFS. More generally, when the objective is understood but the best action order is unclear, pathfinding, flood fill, BFS, DFS, beam search, shortest-path search, limited action-sequence search, or custom heuristics are all valid.\n"
    "- Optimize for the shortest reliable sequence that advances the current goal as described by your world model. If confidence is low, program a discriminating probe and revise the world model from the result.\n"
    "- Once the important state variables and action effects are sufficiently understood, stop probing and search in the inferred state space.\n"
    "- Inspect current and history frames from Python instead of describing frames freehand.\n"
    "- Never print or echo full board frames. Return only compact derived summaries such as object lists, diffs, coordinates, counts, or tiny local crops.\n"
    "- Keep tool-output context size minimal and decision-oriented so you can quickly compare before/after state. It's fine to write a lot of python code, just make the output short and interpretable\n"
    "- A strong default loop is: summarize the board, infer the desired environment change, write a small scorer or search over candidate sequences, execute the best probe or plan with `action(...)`, then inspect again until you understand exactly what changed.\n"
    "- For object tracking, match objects by color, overlap, bounding box proximity, area change, and edge contact rather than by exact coordinates alone.\n"
    "- For frame diffs, summarize changed cells, color transitions, appearing/disappearing components, movement candidates, and small local row slices around the changed region.\n"
    "- After every action, verify whether gameplay objects changed or whether only a timer, progress bar, or remaining-step bar moved. Do not treat HUD-only changes as evidence that the move worked.\n"
    "- Use `print(...)` for compact summaries, or assign a final compact object to `result`.\n"
    "- Call `action(...)` inside Python rather than returning action text in the chat.\n"
    "- `action(...)` accepts an ordered list of one or more actions. Once your code has selected a reliable sequence, it is often useful to batch it.\n"
    "- You can also call `action(...)` multiple times in one Python snippet, including inside loops. Each call updates the preloaded variables before execution continues.\n"
